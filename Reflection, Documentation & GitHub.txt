Reflection, Documentation & GitHub best practices

• What were the most surprising insights from this dataset?

It was surprising to see how gender significantly influences the choice of dating apps. For instance, certain apps like Hinge and Bumble were more popular among non-binary users, while Tinder had a more balanced distribution across genders.

• What would you do differently if given more time?

I would have conducted more advanced statistical analyses, such as regression models, to understand the factors influencing user satisfaction and app preferences more deeply.

• How can we improve dataset documentation for others?

By including information on how the data was collected, the time period, and any sampling methods used. This helps users understand the context and potential biases in the data.
